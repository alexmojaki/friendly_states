    "## BaseState - configuring state storage and changes\n",
    "\n",
    "At the root of all the classes in the library is `BaseState`, which has two abstract methods `get_state` and `set_state`. Subclasses determine how the object stores state and what should happen when it changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is the start of `AttributeState` which we've been using as the base of our machines so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class AttributeState(BaseState):\n",
    "    attr_name = \"state\"\n",
    "\n",

    "        return getattr(self.obj, self.attr_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can declare a different `attr_name` in your machine class to store the state in that attribute of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're storing your state in a dict or similar object, you can instead use `MappingKeyState`, which starts like this:\n",

    "    def start_doing(self) -> Doing:\n",

    "- If your transition has any decorators, make sure that the decorated function still has the original `__annotations__` attribute. This is usually done by using `functools.wraps` when implementing the decorator.\n",
    "- Make sure that the object stores state the way the machine expects. Typically you'll be using `AttributeState` and you should make sure that `attr_name` (\"state\" by default) is correct. Note that a typical machine expects objects to have just one way of storing state - you can't use the same machine to change state stored in different attributes. To overcome this, see the recipes section.\n",
